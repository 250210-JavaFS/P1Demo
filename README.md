# P1Demo
A Full Stack Application with a PostgreSQL Database, Spring Boot backend, and a React frontend

## Full Stack Functionalities
- Login
- Register
- Get All Users
- Spring AOP: Only Managers can get all users
- Spring AOP: Users must log in to do anything besides register

## Backend only Functionalities

- Insert game (Includes invocation of get User by id in service layer)
- Get all games by user id (Just in the DAO... lol)

## Frontend only Functionalities
- Mock Update user
- Mock Delete user
- A Component where a User would, in theory, get a list of all their games with an axios GET request
